Zaeon is an educational platform powered by AI agents that simplifies knowledge access and provides useful tools for students, teachers and researchers. Our mission is to establish a groundbreaking framework that bridges educational communities with blockchain technology through intuitive natural language interactions, advanced generative AI, and specialized chatbots. The project develops a seamless interface where intelligent agents provide personalized guidance to students, teachers, and researchers across diverse scientific disciplines, while simultaneously facilitating the creation and deployment of public goods on the Ethereum blockchain. This dual-purpose approach not only democratizes access to educational resources but also empowers academic communities to participate meaningfully in the decentralized ecosystem.
